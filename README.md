# GordOS

A simple script to setup my Ubuntu system as I like it

## Usage

Just run the main script

```sh
sh gord-os.sh
```

## What does it do?

- Install the programs listed and described in the `progs.tsv` file
- Get some extra programs (actually hard coded)
- Download and compile some tools (also hard coded)
- Disable the login manager
- Set the time language
- Change the user shell
- Apply my [dotfiles](https://github.com/markus-gabryel/dotfiles)

## Why Ubuntu?

I was hopping and I just don't want to change my system again ~by now~
